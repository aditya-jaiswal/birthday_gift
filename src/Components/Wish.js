            <p>
              {bio} This Wordcloud comprises of words from our WhatsApp chat
              history. Just like this Wordcloud we are also comprised of
              different emotions that all come together to form the love that we
              have for each other. There were around 3000 words which we used
              regularly. I ranked these words/phrases based on their frequency
              and then handpicked around 600 words/phrases and made this
              Wordcloud. Letâ€™s see if you can get the reference of all these
              words. Download it and take up the challenge.{" "}
